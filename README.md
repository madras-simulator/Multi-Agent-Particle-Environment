# Multi-Agent-Particle-Environment
Multi Agent Environment for TORCS based on https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs

An example algorithm which uses MPE is Multi Agent DDPG. We have shown MADDPG for TORCS using MPE. 
Link of code of MADDPG: https://github.com/openai/maddpg
Link of paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf

This environment can be used for training any multi agent algorithm. Inter-vehicle communication support is also provided.
